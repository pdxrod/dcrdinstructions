# Instructions for setting up a Decred development node

This means cloning, from Github, the following components, building and running them:

    atomicswap		
    dcrandroid		
    dcrdocs			
    dcrwebapi		
    politeia
    base58			
    dcrd			
    dcrseeder		
    decrediton		
    politeiagui
    bitcore			
    dcrdata			
    dcrstakepool		
    gominer			
    contractor-mgmt		
    dcrdesign		
    dcrtime			
    hardforkdemo		
    testnetfaucet
    dcps			
    dcrwallet		
    insight
    dcraddrgen		
    dcrdocker		
    dcrweb			

These call all be found at [github.com/decred](https://github.com/decred).

E.g. `git clone https://github.com/decred/dcrd`

If you don't have the Git version control system, you need to download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and install it on your system.

Most of the information here can also be found in the README.md files in each of the folders listed above (except in dcps, the file is called README.mediawiki).

All the instructions below assume a Unix-like environment. If you are using Windows, in order to follow these instructions, you need to obtain Cygwin from [http://cygwin.com/](http://cygwin.com/). Cygwin is a Unix-like shell, like the Windows Command Prompt, but with a more extensive set of commands.
